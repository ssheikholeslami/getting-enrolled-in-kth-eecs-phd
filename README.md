# How to Become a KTH EECS PhD Student
A guide for prospective PhD students who have received an offer of admission to the Doctoral Program of EECS school of KTH.

Note that this is a draft version, and it is your personal responsibility to eventually double check and make sure you are following the regulations. This guide is only based on the personal experience of a few of my friends and myself.


**TL;DR** If you are eligible for third-cycle studies, AND if you have received acceptance to a third-cycle program at the EECS school of KTH, you then need to 1) Complete the application form and wait for the *decision on admission* to get admitted into the program, and 2) Sign the employment agreement (contract) so that you get enrolled in the doctoral program as a KTH employee. Your official job title would then be a **Doctoral Student**.


# Third-cycle Studies

In the European education system, Third-cycle studies, which you can safely assume as almost equivalent to PhD studies, follow the first-cycle and second-cycle stuides (Bachelor's and Master's). You can read more about the cycles [here](https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/national-policies/eurydice/content/third-cycle-phd-programmes-80_en).
